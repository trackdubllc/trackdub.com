const FAQS: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "What is dubbing AI?",
    a: "Dubbing AI is a chain of models that transcribes source speech, translates it, assigns speakers, generates target-language voices, and mixes them back with the original music and effects. It's a pipeline, not a single model.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best AI dubbing software in 2026?",
    a: "The best AI dubbing software depends on the work. Cloud services are fine for one-off social clips. For serial work, NDA footage, or client backlogs, a local-first AI dubbing tool like Trackdub gives you stage-level control, resumable jobs, and no per-minute billing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I dub a video with AI locally on my own PC?",
    a: "Yes. A modern consumer GPU with DirectML or TensorRT RTX runs the full AI video dubbing stack — ASR, translation, TTS, and mix — faster than real-time. CPU fallback keeps a laptop usable for shorter jobs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is AI voice dubbing accurate enough for professional work?",
    a: "Modern AI voice dubbing handles tone, pacing, and speaker identity well, but no model is perfect on names, jargon, or overlapping speech. Professional results come from tools that let you edit the transcript, translation, speaker map, and individual TTS takes without rerunning the whole pipeline.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a free AI dubbing tool?",
    a: "Most cloud AI dubbing services offer a limited free tier with watermarks and per-minute caps. Trackdub ships a free desktop tier with a five-minute project limit and a watermark, and a one-time Pro license at $149 for unlimited local use with no watermark.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does AI dubbing cost?",
    a: "Cloud tools typically bill per minute of output, often forever. Traditional studio dubbing can run tens of dollars per finished minute. Trackdub's Free tier is watermarked and capped at five minutes; Pro is a $149 one-time license with unlimited local runs and no per-minute fee.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does AI dubbing include lip sync?",
    a: "Some cloud products regenerate mouth movements frame by frame. Trackdub focuses on audio dubbing: transcription, translation, speaker-aware TTS, timing, and mix. Lip sync is on the roadmap as an inspectable stage, not a black-box default. If on-camera mouth match is the primary deliverable today, evaluate a lip-sync-first cloud tool alongside a local audio workstation.",
  },
  {
    q: "AI dubbing vs subtitles: which should I use?",
    a: "Subtitles are cheaper and preserve the original performance; they fail when viewers can't or won't read. AI dubbing reaches broader audiences and keeps eyes on the picture, but it needs editable stages for names, tone, and timing. Many teams ship both: a dubbed mix for immersion and captions for accessibility.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many languages does AI video dubbing support?",
    a: "Language coverage depends on the underlying ASR, MT, and TTS models. Trackdub ships with dozens of source and target languages at launch and adds more as upstream models improve.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does local AI dubbing keep my footage private?",
    a: "Yes — that's the point of a local-first workflow. Media, transcripts, and voice prints stay on your machine. Cloud stages are opt-in per project, per stage, and never implicit.",

            <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl">What is dubbing AI?</h2>
            <p>
              Dubbing AI is a chain of models, not a single one. A source video is transcribed,
              translated, cut into speaker turns, revoiced with synthesized speech, and mixed back
              against the original music and effects. AI video dubbing tools stitch these stages
              into one pipeline; the quality of the finished dub is the quality of the weakest link.
              Every stage has its own failure modes — mistranscribed names, off-tone translations,
              the wrong speaker on a line, a TTS take that overruns the shot.
            </p>
            <p>
              Searchers call this stack many names: AI dubbing, AI video dubbing, AI voice dubbing,
              or simply “dub a video with AI.” Under every label, the same six-stage pipeline does
              the work. What changes between tools is how much of that pipeline you can inspect,
              edit, and re-run without starting over.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl">How AI video dubbing works: the six stages</h2>
            <p>
              Treat each stage as a contract with clear inputs and outputs. When something sounds
              wrong in the final mix, the fix almost always lives in one of these six places — not
              in “regenerate everything.”

              Modern consumer GPUs run the entire dubbing AI stack fast enough for production.
              DirectML and TensorRT RTX push ASR and AI voice dubbing well past real-time on a
              mid-range card; CPU fallback keeps the pipeline usable on laptops. Once inference
              lives on your hardware, sovereignty, cost, and iteration speed change at once.

                Local acceleration is real — DirectML, TensorRT RTX, or equivalent — with an honest

                Pricing matches the work: free evaluation without a card, then a clear path to
                unlimited local use. Trackdub's Free tier is watermarked and capped at five minutes;
                Pro is $149 one-time with no per-minute billing.

            <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl">Honest limitations</h2>
            <p>
              No AI dubbing tool is magic. Overlapping speech, heavy accents, on-screen text that
              contradicts the spoken line, and music-bed bleed still need human judgment. Lip-sync
              regeneration is a separate problem from audio dubbing: some cloud products lead there
              today; Trackdub prioritizes inspectable audio stages and treats lip sync as a future
              pipeline stage, not a hidden rewrite of your picture.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your deliverable is a talking-head with perfect mouth match in twenty languages by
              tomorrow morning, a lip-sync-first cloud stack may be the right first pass. If your
              deliverable is a season under NDA with glossary control and per-line fixes,
              local-first audio dubbing is the durable workstation.

              <li>
                <strong>Cloud end-to-end dubbing</strong> (tools in the Rask / HeyGen / similar
                lane): fast one-offs, social clips, demos where upload risk is acceptable.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Voice-first APIs</strong> (ElevenLabs and peers): custom pipelines when you
                already own ASR/translation and only need TTS.

              <li>
                <strong>Editor suites with light dubbing</strong> (Descript-style): short form

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Local-first workstations</strong> (Trackdub): serial volume, privacy, stage
                edits, resumable jobs, and predictable cost after a one-time license.

            <p>
              Trackdub is a desktop workstation built around this philosophy: dubbing AI as a
              pipeline you drive, not a service you submit to. Drop in a clip, pick a target
              language, and Trackdub runs ingest, ASR, translation, diarization, AI voice dubbing,
              and mix as separate, inspectable stages. Fix one line, reassign a speaker, swap a
              voice — the rest of the project stays intact. Media stays local unless you explicitly
              opt a stage into a cloud model.
